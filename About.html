                <h1>The most historic location in Galway</h1>
                <p> Prior to the development of the New Docks harbour in the 1840’s the business yards of the local merchants located on Merchant’s Road extended from the businesses to the sea. In that time the harbour, mostly used by small fishing vessels, was centred around Long Walk and Claddagh. The additional docks that can be seen from Rúibín Bar and Restaurant were built in the 1840’s and 1850’s giving rise to the street names “New Docks Road” and “New Docks Street.” These were extended in the 1930’s and deepened in the 1960’s. As well as building the Docks, in approximately 1850 a number of houses and stores were built, including those now forming the bar and restaurant. At that time Captain Neil Delargy, from Cushindall in Antrim, frequently carried cargoes too and from the newly developed harbour. He met and married a widow from Connemara and the family settled in the houses currently no. 1 to no. 5 New Docks Road. The houses become business places as well as residences. As a ships captain Neil Delargy was frequently absent and therefore did not supervise directly the property. Over some years dock related businesses developed in the property. One such business, carried on in the premises beside Rúibín, was a “Seaman’s Home” where seamen who were looking for a berth would lodge temporarily. A second such business was a bar and grocery on the ground floor of Rúibín. In those days there were no distinctions made between bar and grocery business and, until the late 1860’s, no special liquor licence was required. When a licence was required it was obtained and the first extant Custom House record of its granting was 1883. Essentially the premises consisted of a small “snug” where captains transacted business, a stone floored room where goods were sold and a back room where seamen and fishermen drank.</p>
